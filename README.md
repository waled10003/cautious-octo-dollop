# MODMAIL BOT V2.0 with DJS V13.
### Bot Setup:
***REPLIT:*** Go to secrets, set in the key case `TOKEN` and in value case your bot token. (To protect your bot token from attackers) <br>
***VISUAL STUDIO CODE:*** Go to config.json and set your bot token in the variable called `TOKEN`.

### Server Setup:
Set your server id in **config.json**, you can also set a category channel in config.json, but not required, because the system when detects the *CATEROGY_ID* is undefined or 0, then the bot will automatically create a category called "Mod Mail" if you restarted your bot.

If you have created your own category, set the category id in **config.json**, and **delete** the created cathegory by the bot (called "Mod Mail") so the bot won't send the mails throught the created cathegory, only in yours.

### FAQs:
#### Is quick.db version 7 like the version 9?
No, quick.db v7 is not like v9. The version 9 is better than v7 because there are new methods: `.deleteAll()` and `.pull()`. Documentation is linked [here](https://quickdb.js.org/).

###### Fun fact: I created this bot under 30 mins :big_brain:
